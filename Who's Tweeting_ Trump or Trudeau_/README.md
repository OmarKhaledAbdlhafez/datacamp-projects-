### working with Tweet classification: Trump vs. Trudeau data set which contain tweets of Trump and Trudeau the main task is to make a classification model which can guess who's is tweet ?
#### Frist Text pre-processing is needed for transferring text from human language to machine-readable format for further processing. The following pre-processing steps are applied to texts :
- Convert all words to lowercase
- Remove non-alphabet characters and urls using regx
- Remove short word (length less than 3)
- Tokenization: breaking sentences into words
- Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: process of classifying words into their grammatical category
- Lemmatization: converting a word to its base using pos tagging
- Remove stop words ( English + French ) and adding french as Trudeau speak some french words
Apply all those steps on the dataset and then collect all tweets words and get the bigram ( each two sequence words ) and counter them to see which common bigram words each person talk about .
Using  CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer approach to vectorize the data , CountVectorizer creates a dictionary containing the occurrence number of tokens, while TfidfVectorizer generates a dictionary with the tf-idf values of tokens.
use the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes model and SVC model to learn from the training data and classify the testing data and get the the confusion matrix for each one
Adding  some improvements ( Pipline , GridSearcCv ) which make better score .
